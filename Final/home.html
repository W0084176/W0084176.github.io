<p>
My name is Daniel and I am currently a student at NSCC studying IT-Database Administration. In prior years, I graduated from NSCC with
a diploma in IT-Systems Management and Networking.
</p>

<p>
I am originally, from Granby, Quebec which is a city 1 hour outside of Montreal. When I was living in Quebec, I actually went to a completely 
french school therefore am bilingual. 
</p>
<p>
In 1999, my family decided to move to Bridgetown Nova Scotia which is a small town in the Annapolis valley. That is where I finished my high school education.
When I graduated, that is when I decided to go to college and study Information Technology for the first time. So a few years later I graduated and 
since then been working various jobs.
</p>
<p>
For the last few years I lived at home I would work with my fathers landscaping business where I would help with:
<ul>
<li>Tree cutting</li>
<li>Stump removal</li>
<li>Chopping up wood</li>
<li>Planting hedges</li>
<li>Mowing lawns</li>
<li>and so on.... </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
When I decided to leave home in 2011, I ended up getting into the construction idustry where I got into:
<ul>
<li>Landscaping</li>
<li>Installing flooring (hardwood, tile, carpet, vinyl)</li>
<li>Hardwood refinishing</li>
<li>Concrete leveling</li>
<li>Painting</li>
<li>Carpentry(building wooden structures)</li>
<li>Installing stone walkways</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
In the spring of 2017, I ended being laid off from my construction job and thats when I decided to go back to school and pursue IT for the 
second time.
